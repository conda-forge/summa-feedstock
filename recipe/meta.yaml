  summary: "Hydrologic modeling framework"

  description: |
    SUMMA is a hydrologic modeling framework that can be used for the
    systematic analysis of alternative model conceptualizations with
    respect to flux parameterizations, spatial configurations, and numerical
    solution techniques. It can be used to configure a wide range of
    hydrological model alternatives and we anticipate that systematic model
    analysis will help researchers and practitioners understand reasons
    for inter-model differences in model behavior.
